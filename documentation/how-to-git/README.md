# How to Git

## Option One - Command Line

Note: `git add .` means you want to commit all of the files you've changed/made. Manually committing specific files instead is possible, but just also a huge pain in the ass, to do that just look at option two.

```bash
git add .

git commit -m "<YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE>"

git push
```

## Option Two - VSCode

1. Stage/ add the files you want. The `+` next to `Changes` means you want to stage/add _all_ of the changed and new files.

2. Write a commit message in the textbox, then click the `checkmark` to commit your changes

3. Once you've made the commit, you can click "Sync Changes" to send your changes to github or whatever site has your git repo.
