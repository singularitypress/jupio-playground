# Stying
So, you want to add your own styles to your site. This is probably the simplest and easiest thing you can do (it *can* more complicated I guess if you have a big site or want to use SASS, but doesn't *have* to be). The following steps will assuming you've already viewed the **[Making a Project and Putting it on the Internet](https://github.com/singularitypress/jupio-playground/tree/main/documentation/putting-sites-online)** documentation.

## Steps
1. open your `styles` folder
2. make a css file, whatever you want to call it (for the purpose of this documentation, I'm going to call it `custom.css`)
3. Import the file in `_app.js` with `import "../styles/custom.css";`
4. Add... whatever styles you want to your new css file.

And that's it really.
